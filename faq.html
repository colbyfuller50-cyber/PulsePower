<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div class="card">
  <h3>1) How much does it cost?</h3><p>$5.00 per hour. A $45 hold is authorized at checkout and released when you return the battery; you only pay for your rental time.</p>
  <h3>2) Where can I return?</h3><p>To any PulsePower station. Returning to a different station is okay as long as it’s a PulsePower unit.</p>
  <h3>3) What if I forget to return?</h3><p>We send reminders. After 48 hours, the $45 hold may convert to a replacement charge.</p>
  <h3>4) Do I need my own cable?</h3><p>No. Each battery includes Lightning and USB‑C cables built in.</p>
  <h3>5) Is wireless charging supported?</h3><p>Our packs are cable‑based for speed and compatibility. You can use your own wireless puck if desired.</p>
  <h3>6) How many charges will I get?</h3><p>Typically 1–2 full phone charges depending on device and usage.</p>
  <h3>7) Can I rent more than one battery?</h3><p>Yes, if the station has stock.</p>
  <h3>8) What devices are compatible?</h3><p>Most modern phones and accessories using Lightning or USB‑C connectors.</p>
  <h3>9) Are the units safe?</h3><p>Yes. Our batteries are certified and undergo routine inspection and sanitation.</p>
  <h3>10) Can I walk around while charging?</h3><p>Absolutely. The battery is portable and designed for on‑the‑go use.</p>
  <h3>11) Do you charge partial hours?</h3><p>Time is prorated to the minute. You pay only for time used.</p>
  <h3>12) What happens if a cable is broken?</h3><p>Return the unit and grab another. Email support so we can service the damaged one.</p>
  <h3>13) Do you take cash?</h3><p>No. We accept major cards and digital wallets via kiosk checkout.</p>
  <h3>14) Can I reserve ahead?</h3><p>Not yet — first‑come, first‑serve. A live availability map is planned.</p>
  <h3>15) Who do I contact?</h3><p>Email <a href="mailto:pulsepowerrental@gmail.com">pulsepowerrental@gmail.com</a> and we’ll help.</p>
